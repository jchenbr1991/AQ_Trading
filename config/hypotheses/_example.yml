# Example Hypothesis YAML
# -----------------------
# This file demonstrates the structure of a hypothesis configuration.
# Files starting with underscore (_) are skipped by the loader.
#
# To create a real hypothesis:
# 1. Copy this file and rename without underscore (e.g., memory_demand_2027.yml)
# 2. Fill in all required fields
# 3. Ensure at least one falsifier is defined
# 4. Submit via PR for review

# Unique identifier (lowercase alphanumeric with underscores only)
id: memory_demand_2027

# Human-readable title
title: AI Memory Demand Growth Hypothesis

# Natural language statement of the hypothesis
statement: |
  AI compute demand will drive memory prices up through 2027.
  The hypothesis is based on the observation that AI models are
  becoming increasingly memory-intensive, and supply cannot keep
  up with demand in the short to medium term.

# Scope defines what symbols/sectors this hypothesis applies to
# Empty lists mean "all symbols" or "all sectors"
scope:
  symbols:
    - NVDA
    - AMD
    - MU
    - SK_HYNIX
  sectors:
    - semiconductors
    - memory

# Owner is always "human" - hypotheses are human-owned
owner: human

# Lifecycle status: DRAFT, ACTIVE, SUNSET, REJECTED
# DRAFT -> ACTIVE requires PR merge approval
status: DRAFT

# How often to review this hypothesis
review_cycle: quarterly

# Date the hypothesis was created
created_at: "2026-01-15"

# Supporting evidence for the hypothesis
evidence:
  sources:
    - "https://example.com/ai-memory-demand-report-2026"
    - "internal/research/memory_analysis_q1_2026.pdf"
  notes: |
    Based on semiconductor industry analysis and AI model size trends.
    Key data points:
    - GPU memory requirements doubled YoY for large models
    - DRAM supply constraints expected through 2027

# Falsifiers - rules that can invalidate this hypothesis
# At least one falsifier is REQUIRED (gate:hypothesis_requires_falsifiers)
falsifiers:
  # Falsifier 1: If memory IC shows negative returns
  - metric: rolling_ic_mean
    operator: "<"
    threshold: 0
    window: 6m
    trigger: review  # Alert for human review

  # Falsifier 2: If sector underperforms significantly
  - metric: sector_relative_return
    operator: "<"
    threshold: -0.15
    window: 4q
    trigger: sunset  # Automatically sunset the hypothesis

# L1 Constraints derived from this hypothesis (populated after constraints are created)
